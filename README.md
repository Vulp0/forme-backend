# ForMe backend

This is purely the backend for the app except it's broken for now. 

Front end can be found here: https://github.com/Vulp0/forme-frontend. 

No hosting as of yet. Currently not working because i got stuck on an Sequelize error.

### Installation

* Navigate to a new directory then run `git clone https://github.com/Vulp0/forme-backend server`
* Go into the client folder and run `npm install`
* You can start the server with `npm run startServer` but you'll just get the error i mentioned before (something about Sequelize: belongsTo called with something that's not a subclass of Sequelize.Model)
